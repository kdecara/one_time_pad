    "# Intro To Stream Ciphers\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to show how lazy implementation of cryptographic algoritms, specifically the one-time pad, can\n",
    "lead to easily breakable ciphers. In this case, I show how using anything but TRNG or CSRNG for the one-time pad can make an unbreakable cipher easy to break. Credit to *Understanding Cryptography* by Paar and Pelzl.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stream ciphers encrypt bits individually, as opposed to block ciphers, which encrypt blocks at a time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Encryption:** $y_i = e(x_i) = x_i + s_i \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Decryption:** $x_i = d(y_i) = y_i + s_i \\mod 2$\n",
    "\n",
    "Where $x_i, y_i, s_i$ consist of the plaintext, ciphertext, and key bit, respectively. In our case, we will be encrypting characters at a time.\n",
    "Note that encryption and decryption are the same function, and that modulo 2 arithmetic is equivalent to the XOR function as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$0 + 1 \\mod 2 = 1,  0 \\oplus 1 = 1$\n",
    "$1 + 1 \\mod 2 = 0,  0 \\oplus 0 = 0$\n",
    "\n",
    "The XOR = $\\oplus$ function is used because, depending on the key bit $s_i$, there is a 50% chance for the the ciphertext $y_i$\n",
    "is either a 0 or 1. Also, the same keystream can be used for decryption and encryption, which is not true for the OR, AND, or NAND gates. Specifically, the AND and NAND gates are not invertible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The security of stream ciphers depends upon the unpreditability of the individual key bits $s_i$, and the random number generators used to generate them.\n",

    "\n",
    "While the One-Time pad is unconditionally secure (cannot be broken even with infinite computational resources), it isn't widely used for a variety of reasons. Since every key bit is unique and cannot be reused, the key is as along as the message. So, encrypting a 1 MB file means also sharing a 1 MB key. Issues also arise in keeping the key stream only know to legitimate communication parties. How would this key be shared? For example: If a One-Time pad is used to encrypt an email message, and the key stream is also sent via email, the key stream itself would need to be encrypted. This presents obvious security vulnerabilities. Even if the sender and receiver of the email agree on a truly random key stream before hand, they would have to agree on another key stream to send another email. You can see how this can become impractical."
